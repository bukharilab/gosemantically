# goSemantically Information Reterivial Solution

The portable document format (PDF) is currently one of the most popular formats for offline sharing biomedical information. Recently, HTML-based formats for web-first biomedical information sharing have gained popularity. However, machine-interpretable information is required by literature search engines, such as Google Scholar, to index articles in a context-aware manner for accurate biomedical literature searches. The lack of technological infrastructure to add machine-interpretable metadata to expanding biomedical information, on the other hand, renders them unreachable to search engines. Therefore, we developed a portable technical infrastructure (goSemantically) and packaged it as a Google Docs add-ons. The ‚ÄúgoSemantically‚Äù assists authors in adding machine-interpretable metadata at the terminology and document structural levels While authoring biomedical content. The ‚ÄúgoSemantically‚Äù leverages the NCBO Bioportal resources and introduces a mechanism to annotate biomedical information with relevant machine-interpretable metadata (semantic vocabularies). The ‚ÄúgoSemantically‚Äù also acquires schema.org meta tags designed for search engine optimization and tailored to accommodate biomedical information. Thus, individual authors can conveniently author and publish biomedical content in a truly decentralized fashion. Users can also export and host content with relevant machine-interpretable metadata (semantic vocabularies) in interoperable formats such as HTML and JSON-LD.
